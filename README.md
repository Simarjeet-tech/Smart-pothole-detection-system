# Smart-pothole-detection-system
  A deep learning–based solution for automatic pothole detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and image processing. This project leverages Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow/Keras to detect potholes from road images or video frames with high accuracy. The system preprocesses input images, extracts features using a trained CNN model
